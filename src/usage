    sign        Sign a PBO with the given private key.
    paa2img     Convert PAA to image (PNG only).
    img2paa     Convert image to PAA.

Options:
    -f --force      Overwrite the target file/folder if it already exists.
    -p --packonly   Don't binarize models, configs etc.
    -w --warning    Warning to disable (repeatable).
    -i --include    Folder to search for includes, defaults to CWD (repeatable).
                        For unpack: pattern to include in output folder (repeatable).
    -x --exclude    Glob patterns to exclude from PBO (repeatable).
                        For unpack: pattern to exclude from output folder (repeatable).
    -k --key        Private key to use for signing the PBO.
    -d --indent     String to use for indentation. "    " (4 spaces) by default.
    -z --compress   Compress final PAA where possible.
    -t --type       PAA type. One of: DXT1, DXT3, DXT5, ARGB4444, ARGB1555, AI88
                        Currently only DXT1 and DXT5 are implemented.
    -h --help       Show usage information and exit.

Warnings:
    By default, armake prints all warnings. You can mute trivial warnings
    using the name that is printed along with them.

    Example: "-w unquoted-string" disables warnings about improperly quoted
             strings.

BI tools on Windows:
    Since armake's P3D converter is not finished yet, armake attempts to find
    and use BI's binarize.exe on Windows systems. If you don't want this to
    happen and use armake's instead, pass the environment variable NATIVEBIN.

    Since binarize.exe's output is usually excessively verbose, it is hidden
    by default. Pass BIOUTPUT to display it.
